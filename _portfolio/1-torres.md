The concept of Smart Transportation has become more predominant over the past decade, encompassing innovative methods for the reduction of traffic congestion, traffic accidents, and air pollution, all of which engender excessive costs to society and impact the general well-being of citizens. TORRES project aims at developing both a framework and methodology for the monitoring of heterogeneous traffic data. Specifically:

* Develop the necessary dashboards and frameworks for traffic analysis, monitoring, and prediction on the scale of a metropolitan city such as Brussels.

* Enriching knowledge about the dynamics of urban mobility in the Brussels region through the integration of real data, collected from existing monitoring infrastructures and opportunely anonymized, and synthetic data created through data augmentation methods.

* Aggregating raw mobility data acquired from IoT-connected devices and from existing monitoring infrastructures to infer information useful for mobility policymakers.

* Creating new Artificial Intelligence-based methods for interpolating mobility data considering the uncertainties and unpredictable dynamics of the physical environment.
