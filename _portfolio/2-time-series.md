A ramp event refers to a sudden and significant change in wind power generation over a short period, either an abrupt increase or decrease in output. These events pose challenges for power system operators, as they can disrupt grid stability and complicate the balance between supply and demand. Understanding and managing ramp events is therefore essential for maintaining reliable and resilient energy systems with high shares of renewable generation. This project addresses several interconnected topics, including the identification and characterization of ramp occurrences, forecasting algorithms based on time series and machine learning, uncertainty quantification to assess the confidence of predictions, and the integration of ramp forecasts into grid operation and decision-support tools. Other possible directions include data-driven feature extraction, real-time detection frameworks, and adaptive control strategies that mitigate the operational impacts of ramp events.
