Short introduction

Research interests
======

Something here

Beyond academia
======

By day, I’m a researcher in Machine Learning. By night... well, still a researcher in Machine Learning, but with worse lighting.

:evergreen_tree: I am passionate about nature, and a good hike in the forest will always be my go-to when trying to escape the noise of everyday life — at least until my inbox catches up with me.

:art: I recently discovered I can make fancy lines on paper, some people even call it drawing. Since then, I have become fascinated with cartography, especially creating fantasy maps in ink. Yes, I know, another D&D nerd, shocking!  

:book: When I have time and I am not falling asleep in front of the TV, I like to read fantasy books before going to bed. 'The Wheel of Time' has been keeping me thoroughly captivated recently.
