Welcome to my personal page! Here you will find an overview of my main projects and publications. I hold a degree in Computer Science from the Central University of Las Villas, Cuba, and have more than 10 years of research experience in Artificial Intelligence. Both my Bachelor’s and Master’s research were centered on developing and applying diversity measures to design ensembles of classifiers, aiming to improve predictive performance in bioinformatics problems such as protein classification. In 2019, I moved to Belgium to begin my PhD studies at UHasselt, focusing on smart optimization for complex, uncertain, and computationally expensive problems, as well as challenges in time series analysis. Additionally, I have experience in project management and software development, working both with the scientific community and within business environments.  

I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Machine Learning Group at the Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), where I work on projects related to mobility and energy. In parallel, I serve as a Research Collaborator at UHasselt, focusing on the intersection of optimization and Machine Learning algorithms.

By day, I’m a researcher in Machine Learning. By night... well, still a researcher in Machine Learning, but with worse lighting.

:evergreen_tree: I am passionate about nature, and a good hike in the forest will always be my go-to when trying to escape the noise of everyday life — at least until my inbox catches up with me.

:art: I recently discovered I can make fancy lines on paper, some people even call it drawing. Since then, I have become fascinated with cartography, especially creating fantasy maps in ink. Yes, I know, another D&D nerd, shocking!  

:book: When I have time and I am not falling asleep in front of the TV, I like to read fantasy books before going to bed. 'The Wheel of Time' has been keeping me thoroughly captivated recently.
