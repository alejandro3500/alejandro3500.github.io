In this tutorial, we introduce how Bayesian optimization (BO) can be applied to process-optimization tasks for researchers and practitioners, using an adhesive bonding process as example. We explain the theoretical foundations of BO and provide practical guidance (yes, with code) for implementing it in real-world workflows.
