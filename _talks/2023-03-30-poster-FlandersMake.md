The literature on multi-objective optimization is vast. However, in practice not only the most commonly used approaches can yield bad quality solutions, but the noisy performance is often neglected and the problem is treated as deterministic. In this work we highlight some of the most crucial pitfalls when using common multi-objective algorithms in practice.
