In supervised learning, a single model often struggles to capture all the underlying patterns of a complex problem. As tasks become more complex and the consequences of inaccurate predictions grow more significant, more sophisticated approaches are required. This challenge has motivated the development and success of ensemble systems, which combine multiple models to achieve higher accuracy, robustness,  and generalization than any individual model. In this presentation, I will outline the fundamental components of ensemble learning and discuss the three principal architectures commonly found in the literature: Bagging, Boosting, and Stacking. Finally, three case studies will be presented (related to unbalanced learning, missing data imputation, and data fusion) to demonstrate how each of these architectures can be effectively applied to real-world problems in traffic and energy systems.
