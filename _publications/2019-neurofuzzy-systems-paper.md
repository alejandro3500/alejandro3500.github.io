The prevention of arterial hypertension is not always transferred to the pediatric age and many of the classification algorithms applied to its diagnosis do not offer relevant information. The aim of this paper is to diagnose the risk of hypertension in children using neurofuzzy systems. Three neurofuzzy systems were applied to the diagnosis of this disease and the experimental data were obtained by the PROCDEC project of schoolchildren in Santa Clara, Cuba. Twenty-four variables were analysed in 624 children from 8 to 11 years old, classified as normotensive and at risk of suffering hypertension. After applying the neurofuzzy systems of study, the performance of each one of them was evaluated and the rules generated during the training of the best were analysed. It was determined that the NSLV algorithm provides a set of rules that facilitate the diagnosis of high blood pressure risk in children.
